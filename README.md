# EXPLANATION-OF-CALCULATOR
Sure! Let's go through the structure and functionality of a simple calculator project in C without the actual code.

### Project Structure

The calculator project will have the following components:
1. **Header File (`calculator.h`)**: Contains declarations of the functions for different arithmetic operations.
2. **Source File (`calculator.c`)**: Contains definitions of the functions declared in the header file.
3. **Main File (`main.c`)**: Contains the main function to handle user input and call the appropriate arithmetic functions.

### 1. Header File (`calculator.h`)

#### Purpose:
- To declare functions for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- To provide a way for the main file to access these functions.

#### Structure:
- Function declarations for each arithmetic operation.

### 2. Source File (`calculator.c`)

#### Purpose:
- To define the functions declared in the header file.
- Each function performs a specific arithmetic operation and returns the result.

#### Structure:
- **Addition Function**: Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
- **Subtraction Function**: Takes two numbers as input and returns the difference (first number minus the second number).
- **Multiplication Function**: Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
- **Division Function**: Takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient (first number divided by the second number), handling division by zero appropriately.

### 3. Main File (`main.c`)

#### Purpose:
- To handle user input and output.
- To determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user input.
- To call the appropriate function from the source file and display the result.

#### Structure:
1. **User Input Handling**:
   - Prompts the user to enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., `1 + 2`).
   - Reads the input values and the operator.

2. **Operation Selection**:
   - Uses a control structure (e.g., a `switch` statement) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator.
   - Calls the corresponding function from `calculator.c` for the operation.

3. **Output**:
   - Displays the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.

### Example Flow of the Calculator Project

1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., `3.5 * 2`).
   - The user inputs the expression.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - The program parses the input to extract the two numbers and the operator.

3. **Operation Selection**:
   - The program uses a control structure to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

4. **Function Call**:
   - The appropriate function is called with the extracted numbers as arguments.
   - For example, if the operator is `*`, the multiplication function is called with `3.5` and `2` as arguments.

5. **Performing the Operation**:
   - The function performs the arithmetic operation and returns the result.
   - In this example, the multiplication function returns `7.0`.

6. **Displaying the Result**:
   - The program displays the result to the user.
   - The output is: `Result: 7.00`.

### Summary

- **Header File (`calculator.h`)**: Declares functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Source File (`calculator.c`)**: Defines the functions that perform the arithmetic operations.
- **Main File (`main.c`)**: Handles user input, determines the operation to perform, calls the appropriate function, and displays the result.

By organizing the project in this way, the code is modular and easy to understand, allowing each part of the program to focus on a specific task.
